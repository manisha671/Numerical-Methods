# Numerical-Methods
Numerical Solutions and iterations via Matlab programming
this repository contains all the codes that are necessary to find a unique solution to all the iterative or direct calculations of ODE and PDE.
also it contains the basis and theory of each methods. 
look in the file name basis_name for theory and solution_name for the codes
